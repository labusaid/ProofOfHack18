# Data Hash

## Inspiration
Big data is becoming increasingly valuable. The only problem is giant corporations (Google, Facebook) hold all of it. Our project is designed to reduce this, by allowing companies and users to sell data on a decentralized marketplace. 

## Interplanitary File System
https://ipfs.io/

## What it does
Our project creates a platform for a selling and buying valuable data on the blockchain. Payments are done through the smart contracts, then the data becomes encrypted and stored on the interplanetary file system. The IPFS is a decentralized web and file hosting service. Once the user has access to ipfs they can download, and unencrypted with their key. Since the IPFS address is stored on the blockchain. The user will not lose access to data after purchasing. 
## What data can be stored
Any data, from labeled images for AI, text files, to media. This data can then be used to train machine learning models.
## How we built it
We built this using IPFS, React, Nodejs, js, npm, solidity, metamask, ether.
